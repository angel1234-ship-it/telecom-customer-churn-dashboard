# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn for a fictional telecommunication company that provides both phone and internet services.
The dataset was downloaded from Maven Analytics
.

The workflow included:

   * Data Cleaning & Preparation → Done in Python (pandas), handling missing values, outliers, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.

   * Feature Engineering → Created strategic metrics to quantify customer risk and value
     
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Performed using pandas (summary statistics) and visual checks such as box plots.

  * Visualization & Dashboard → Built in Power BI to uncover insights about churn drivers, tenure, payment methods, referrals, and revenue distribution.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

1) Checked for duplicate rows → none found.

2) Imputed "Active" for blank cells in the churn category of active users.

3) Imputed "Not Applicable" for blank cells in the churn reason column.

4) Filled missing values in the Offer column with "None".

5) For missing values in Average Monthly Long Distance:

   *  Created a box plot to check for outliers → none detected.

   *  Imputed missing values with the mean.

6) Replaced NaN values in Multiple Lines column with "No".

7) Corrected negative values in Monthly Charges by imputing them with 0.

8) Created a new feature: Tenure Category

* New: 0–12 months

* Established: 13–23 months

* Loyal: 24+ months

9) Generated descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max) using df.describe().

## ⚙️ Strategic Feature Engineering(The Predictive Layer)
To move beyond descriptive analysis and quantify the risk of the top churn drivers (Competitor Offers/Devices), two key strategic metrics were engineered in Python:Total Revenue (X-Axis): A highly accurate Lifetime Value (LTV) proxy calculated as:

### Total Revenue = ({Total Charges} + {Total Long Distance Charges} + {Total Extra Data Charges}) - {Total Refunds} 
Competitor Vulnerability Score (Y-Axis): A custom metric (Score 0-3) designed to identify customers most susceptible to a competitor's offer. This score combines:Contract Vulnerability: Month-to-Month contracts receive the highest risk score.Support Vulnerability: Customers lacking Premium Tech Support (a premium lock-in feature) receive an additional risk point.This score was visualized against Total Revenue to pinpoint the High-Value / High-Vulnerability segment.

## 🔑 Key Insights

* The majority of company revenue comes from loyal customers with a tenure of 24 months or more.
  
* Over the 72-month period: 67.02% of customers stayed, 26.54% churned, and 6.45% joined.
  
* A significant portion of churned customers were on month-to-month contracts and did not have an offer. This indicates a key opportunity for proactive retention.
  
* Across all tenure categories, customers received a total refund of $13.82K.

* The top churn reasons were:

1) Competitor

2) Dissatisfaction

3) Attitude of support staff

Specifically:

1) 16.75% of churned customers left due to competitors offering better devices.

2) 16.64% due to better offers from competitors.

3) 11.7% due to poor support staff attitude.

* Referrals were mainly generated by loyal customers (76.40%), with 73.01% from stayed customers and 3.40% from churned customers.

* New customers contributed 12.36% of referrals (6.77% stayed, 3.14% joined, 2.45% churned).

* Established customers contributed 11.24% of referrals (10.00% stayed and 1.24% churned).

* The most common payment method was Bank Withdrawal (55.5%), followed by Credit Card and Mail Check.

## 💡 Business Recommendations
### Based on the analysis, here are the key recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer loyalty:

1) Introduce Targeted Offers for At-Risk Customers:Focus on engaging month-to-month customers who do not have an active offer. Incentivize them with a personalized marketing campaign to accept an offer or upgrade to a long-term contract.

2) Invest in Competitive Analysis: The top churn reasons were due to competitors' better devices and offers. The company should conduct a thorough analysis of competitor products and pricing to ensure its offerings remain competitive.

3) Enhance Support Staff Training: Address the significant portion of churn attributed to poor support staff attitude. Implement a training program to improve customer service and satisfaction, strengthening customer relationships.

4) Review Monthly Charge Structures: Evaluate whether monthly charges are perceived as too high by customers, particularly in the month-to-month segment. Consider offering more flexible or affordable plans to retain this group.
