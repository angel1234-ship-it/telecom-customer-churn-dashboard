# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn for a fictional telecommunication company that provides both phone and internet services.
The dataset was downloaded from Maven Analytics
.

The workflow included:

   * Data Cleaning & Preparation → Done in Python (pandas), handling missing values, outliers, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.

  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Performed using pandas (summary statistics) and visual checks such as box plots.

  * Visualization & Dashboard → Built in Power BI to uncover insights about churn drivers, tenure, payment methods, referrals, and revenue distribution.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

1) Checked for duplicate rows → none found.

2) Imputed "Active" for blank cells in the churn category of active users.

3) Imputed "Not Applicable" for blank cells in the churn reason column.

4) Filled missing values in the Offer column with "None".

5) For missing values in Average Monthly Long Distance:

   *  Created a box plot to check for outliers → none detected.

   *  Imputed missing values with the mean.

6) Replaced NaN values in Multiple Lines column with "No".

7) Corrected negative values in Monthly Charges by imputing them with 0.

8) Created a new feature: Tenure Category

* New: 0–12 months

* Established: 13–23 months

* Loyal: 24+ months

9) Generated descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max) using df.describe().

## 🔑 Key Insights

* The majority of company revenue comes from loyal customers with a tenure of 24 months or more.
* Over the 72-month period: 67.02% of customers stayed, 26.54% churned, and 6.45% joined.

* Across all tenure categories, customers received a total refund of $13.82K.

1) Competitor

2) Dissatisfaction

3) Attitude of support staff

Specifically:

1) 16.75% of churned customers left due to competitors offering better devices.

2) 16.64% due to better offers from competitors.

3) 11.7% due to poor support staff attitude.

* Referrals were mainly generated by loyal customers (76.40%), with 73.01% from stayed customers and 3.40% from churned customers.

* New customers contributed 12.36% of referrals (6.77% stayed, 3.14% joined, 2.45% churned).

* Established customers contributed 11.24% of referrals (10.00% stayed and 1.24% churned).

* The most common payment method was Bank Withdrawal (55.5%), followed by Credit Card and Mail Check.
