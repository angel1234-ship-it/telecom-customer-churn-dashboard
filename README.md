# üìä 12:1 ROI: Data-Driven Intervention to Secure $510K in At-Risk Telecom Revenue
## üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn for a fictional telecommunication company that provides both phone and internet services.
The dataset was downloaded from Maven Analytics
.

The workflow included:

   * Data Cleaning & Preparation ‚Üí Done in Python (pandas), handling missing values, outliers, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.

   * Feature Engineering ‚Üí Created strategic metrics to quantify customer risk and value
     
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ‚Üí Performed using pandas (summary statistics) and visual checks such as box plots.

  * Visualization & Dashboard ‚Üí Built in Power BI to uncover insights about churn drivers, tenure, payment methods, referrals, and revenue distribution.

## üßπ Data Cleaning Steps

1) Checked for duplicate rows ‚Üí none found.

2) Imputed "Active" for blank cells in the churn category of active users.

3) Imputed "Not Applicable" for blank cells in the churn reason column.

4) Filled missing values in the Offer column with "None".

5) For missing values in Average Monthly Long Distance:

   *  Created a box plot to check for outliers ‚Üí none detected.

   *  Imputed missing values with the mean.

6) Replaced NaN values in Multiple Lines column with "No".

7) Corrected negative values in Monthly Charges by imputing them with 0.

8) Created a new feature: Tenure Category

* New: 0‚Äì12 months

* Established: 13‚Äì23 months

* Loyal: 24+ months

9) Generated descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max) using df.describe().

## ‚öôÔ∏è Strategic Feature Engineering(The Predictive Layer)
To move beyond descriptive analysis and quantify the risk of the top churn drivers (Competitor Offers/Devices), two key strategic metrics were engineered in Python:Total Revenue (X-Axis): A highly accurate Lifetime Value (LTV) proxy calculated as:

### Total Revenue = (Total Charges + Total Long Distance Charges + Total Extra Data Charges) - Total Refunds
Competitor Vulnerability Score (Y-Axis): A custom metric (Score 0-3) designed to identify customers most susceptible to a competitor's offer. This score combines:Contract Vulnerability: Month-to-Month contracts receive the highest risk score.Support Vulnerability: Customers lacking Premium Tech Support (a premium lock-in feature) receive an additional risk point.This score was visualized against Total Revenue to pinpoint the High-Value / High-Vulnerability segment.

## üîë Key Insights

* The majority of company revenue comes from loyal customers with a tenure of 24 months or more.
  
* Over the 72-month period: 67.02% of customers stayed, 26.54% churned, and 6.45% joined.
  
* A significant portion of churned customers were on month-to-month contracts. This indicates a key opportunity for proactive retention.
  
* Across all tenure categories, customers received a total refund of $13.82K.

* The top churn reasons were:

1) Competitor

2) Dissatisfaction

3) Attitude of support staff

Specifically:

1) 16.75% of churned customers left due to competitors offering better devices.

2) 16.64% due to better offers from competitors.

3) 11.7% due to poor support staff attitude.

* Referrals were mainly generated by loyal customers (76.40%), with 73.01% from stayed customers and 3.40% from churned customers.

* New customers contributed 12.36% of referrals (6.77% stayed, 3.14% joined, 2.45% churned).

* Established customers contributed 11.24% of referrals (10.00% stayed and 1.24% churned).

* The most common payment method was Bank Withdrawal (55.5%), followed by Credit Card and Mail Check.

  ## üí∞ Quantified Strategic Recommendation
The analysis isolated the most critical business risk: 464 high-value Stayed customers sitting in the highest vulnerability quadrant. This led to a quantifiable, high-ROI recommendation.1.

### 1. The Cost of Inaction (ARR at Risk)

| **Metric**                                      | **Value**                | **Strategic Thresholds**               |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Target Customers (N)**                        | 464  Stayed Customers                         |   **Revenue**        ‚â• $4,801.15               |
|        **Total Cumulative Revenue (LTV) at Risk**        |  $3,171,701.46          |  **Vulnerability Score** ‚â• 2                                                    |
|  **Estimated Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) at Risk)**    |    $510,161.40          |  **Average Monthly Charge**    $91.62   |



#### Summary
The **Cost of Inaction** analysis highlights the potential financial impact of losing vulnerable customers.  
A total of **464 target customers** have been identified, each generating significant revenue. The **total lifetime value (LTV) at risk** stands at **$3.17M**, with an **estimated ARR loss of $510K** if these customers churn.  

The **average monthly charge** of **$91.62** per customer reinforces the importance of proactive retention strategies.  
Maintaining engagement and addressing vulnerabilities (score ‚â• 2) could safeguard over half a million dollars in recurring annual revenue.

### 2. Proving Existing Offer Failure
Analysis showed that 79.01% of these 464 high-risk customers were already assigned Offer B (and another $18.11\%$ received Offer A). This proves the current offer strategy is ineffective at creating the necessary lock-in to counter competitor threats.
### 3. High-ROI Intervention (Offer F)

| **Action** | **Total Campaign Cost (Est.)** | **Financial Outcome** |
|-------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Targeted Offer (Offer F):** Free 6-Month Trial of Device Protection Plan **and** Premium Tech Support in exchange for a One-Year Contract Extension. | **$41,760**  <br>(464 customers √ó est. $90 cost/customer) | **Potential 12:1 ROI** (Retained ARR : Cost), securing **over $510K** in annual revenue by addressing top churn reasons such as better devices or competing offers. |

#### Summary
**Offer F** presents a cost-effective strategy to retain high-value customers through an attractive value exchange.  
With an **estimated investment of $41,760**, the campaign could **retain over $510,000 in ARR**, yielding a **12:1 return on investment**.  

By directly tackling key churn drivers ‚Äî customers seeking **better devices or offers** ‚Äî this targeted approach strengthens customer loyalty, increases contract renewals, and sustains long-term revenue growth.
## üí° Secondary Business Imperatives
While the primary focus is securing the $510K ARR at risk, the following high-priority initiatives are necessary to improve the core service offering:

**Enhance Support Staff Training**: Address the significant portion of churn attributed to poor support staff attitude (11.77%). Implement a focused training program to improve customer service and satisfaction, thereby strengthening customer relationships and reducing a key point of friction.
